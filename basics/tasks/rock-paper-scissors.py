import random

# create never-ending loop
    # print the options to choose from: Rock, Paper or Scissors

    # get input from user - specify R for Rock, P for Paper, S for Scissors
    
    # force input to be upper case by using .upper() method

    # create list of three options R, S, P

    # use random.choice() to randomly choose from list


    #Â compare what the user chose vs. what the program chose:
    # case 1 - the options are the same 

    # case 2 - user chooses Paper and program chooses Scissor - program wins

    # case 3 - user chooses Rock and program chooses Paper - program wins

    # case 4 - user chooses Scissor and program chooses Rock - program wins

    # case 5 - anythin else, user wins
